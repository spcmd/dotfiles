## My custom configs for Coolreader using with Pocketbook 515 mini E-reader

[blchinezu/pocketbook-coolreader](blchinezu/pocketbook-coolreader) (for Pocketbook 515 mini it's the firware version 4 (pro4 -> FW4.*))

### slightly modified keymap and menu settings
copy **keymaps.ini** to: `system/share/cr3/keymaps`

### default applications by extensions
copy **extensions.cfg** to: `system/profiles/yourProfileName/config`

### coolreader settings
copy **cr3.ini** to: `system/profiles/yourProfileName/config/cr3`

### Modified quickmenu in the skin for my keymaps.ini (changed the rotate to cite/note)
copy **spcmd.cr3skin** to: `system/share/cr3/skins`

*note: cr3skin is just a renamed zip file*
